Analysis Report:

Per our analysis, 15 different schools fall into two categories, district and charter schools, that have 39170 students in total. Considering the 70/100 as the minimum to pass a course, in general, 74.98% of students passed math, 85.81% passed reading, while only 65.17% of students passed both mathematics and reading exams.  
According to the overall passing rate, the first top schools are all charter schools. On the other hand, the first five low passing schools are all district schools. This fact has been proved by the school-type passing rate, where passing rates were 90.4% and 53.7% at charter and district schools, respectively. While on average, the budgets per capita are higher at district schools in comparison to charter schools. 
Considering the spending range table proved the fact that there was a negative correlation between budget per student and overall passing rate. In other words, spending more money does not guarantee more success. 
Per school size table, the overall rate is pretty same for small and medium schools, i.e., less than 2000 students, however for large schools, the overall passing drops by over 30%.
